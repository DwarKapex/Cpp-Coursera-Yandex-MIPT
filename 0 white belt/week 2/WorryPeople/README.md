# Desctiption

The temperature values observed for N consecutive days are given. Find the numbers of days (numbered from zero) with a temperature value above the arithmetic mean for all N days.

It is guaranteed that the arithmetic mean of the temperature values is an integer.

## Input format
The number N is entered, then N non-negative integers are the temperature values on the 0th, 1st, ... (Nâˆ’1)th day.

## Output format
The first number K is the number of days in which the temperature value is higher than the arithmetic mean. Then K integers are the numbers of these days.
