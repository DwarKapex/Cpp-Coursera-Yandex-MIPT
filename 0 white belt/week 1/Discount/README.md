Write a program to calculate the cost of the purchase, taking into account the discount. A discount of X percent is granted if the purchase amount is more than A rubles, in Y percent - if the amount is more than B rubles.

The standard input contains five real numbers, separated by a space: N, A, B, X, Y (A <B) - where N is the initial cost of the goods. Print the purchase price taking into account the discount.
