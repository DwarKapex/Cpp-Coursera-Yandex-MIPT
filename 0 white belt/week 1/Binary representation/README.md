# Description

The input is given a positive integer N. Output it in binary notation without leading zeros.

# Example

|stdin|stdout|
|-|-|
|5|101|
|32|100000|
|1|1|

# Hint

- The number N can be read into a variable of type int
- In this task the vector container may be useful to you; recall that adding the value of x to the end of the vector v is done like this: v.push_back(x);
