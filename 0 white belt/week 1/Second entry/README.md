Given a string. Find in this line the second occurrence of the letter f and print the index of this occurrence. If the letter f appears in this line only once, print the number -1, and if it does not occur even once, print the number -2. Indexes are numbered from scratch.

Example

stdin       stdout
comfort     -1
coffee         3
car            -2
