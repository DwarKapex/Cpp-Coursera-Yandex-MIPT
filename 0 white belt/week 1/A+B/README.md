2 3             5
-4 -9       -13

Tips

Your program should output only one number in cout - the sum of the entered numbers (that is, do not output input numbers or strings of the type "A =" in cout)
You do not need to check that the input numbers do not exceed 100000 in absolute value. We guarantee that only numbers that satisfy the specified restrictions will be sent to your program in the testing system
