# Desctiption

In the first line of the file input.txt two numbers N and M are written . Next in the file is a table of N rows and M columns, presented in CSV format (comma-separated values). This format is often used for textual representation of tables with data: there are several rows in the file, values from different cells inside the row are separated from each other by commas. Your task is to display the data on the screen in the form of a table. Table format:

 - the cell size is 10,

2) adjacent cells are separated from each other by a space,

3) the last cell in the row does NOT end with a space,

4) the last line does NOT end with a newline character. It is guaranteed that there will be exactly N rows and M columns in the table, the value of each of the cells is an integer. Input example
