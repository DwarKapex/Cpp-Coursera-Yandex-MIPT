# Desctiption

The standard stream is given a single string consisting of N + 1 integers. The first number is the number N itself. Then another N numbers follow, let's denote them as the array A. The numbers are separated by a space.

Sort the array A modulo and print it to the standard stream.

# Restrictions

- 0 <= N <= 1000
- -1000000 <= A[i] <= 1000000

# Example

|input  | output|
|-|-|
|2 -4 3|3 -4|
|3 1 -3 2| 1 2 -3|
