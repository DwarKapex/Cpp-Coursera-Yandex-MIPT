The standard stream is given one line consisting of the number N followed by N lines S. The number and the lines are separated by a space.

Sort the strings S in ascending lexicographic order, ignoring case, and print them to standard output.

# Restrictions
- 0 <= N <= 1000

- 1 <= |S| <= 15

- Each string S[i] can consist of the following characters: [0-9,a-z,A-Z]
