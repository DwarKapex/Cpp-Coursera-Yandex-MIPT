#Description
In the specialization, teachers share their many years of experience creating large C ++ projects. They do not retell the tutorial, but teach them how to solve problems that most developers face in practice. Lectures delivered in an easy and accessible form are supported by a large number of programming tasks. Having finished this specialization, you can not only talk about C ++, comparing it with other languages, but also get a real programming skill.
