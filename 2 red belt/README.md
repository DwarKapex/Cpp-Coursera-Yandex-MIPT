# Description

This course is a follow-up to the C ++ Development Fundamentals: Yellow Belt course. The main goal of the course is to teach writing effective code in C ++. In addition, some C ++ features that were not included in previous courses are considered.

The course examined:
- macros
- class templates
- principles of code optimization
- efficient use of input / output streams
- estimates of the complexity of the algorithms
- memory model in C ++
- efficient use of linear containers (vector, deque, list, string)
- move semantics
- introduction to multithreaded programming

In addition, the course demonstrates how, using the knowledge of only the "White", "Yellow" and "Red" belts, to develop your own profiler.

As in previous courses, at the end you will find the final project. It would be strange to know from Yandex not to ask you to create your own search engine! This is what you have to do in the final task.
