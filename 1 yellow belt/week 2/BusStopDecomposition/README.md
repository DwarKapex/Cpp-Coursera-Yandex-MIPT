# Desctiption

In the course "White Belt in C++" we had the task "Bus stops - 1". In this task, you will be given its correct solution, entirely contained within the main function. You will need to decompose this solution into predefined blocks so that the resulting program also correctly solves the problem. The condition of the problem "Bus stops - 1" is given below, which contains blanks of classes and functions. **Without changing the main function**, you need to implement these classes and functions so that the resulting program solves the problem "Bus stops - 1".
